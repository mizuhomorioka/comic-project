# comic-project
## about this project
this is a repository for my third project of [the Lede program 2023](https://ledeprogram.com/).
I chose this topic because I wanted to practice scraping tables and scroll-telling, which is easy to express.
I got the data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_comic_series), and scraped data from different two tables and combined them. I cleaned the data and added extra data and to make it easy to exampine the difference between coutnries.
To visualize, I used datawrapper and flourish, and edited on AdobeIllustrator. Then, I extracted html using ai2html. Also, I made scrolltelling by using [Soma's youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ1g7d5BPYQ).

## Data Source
I used [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_comic_series) and before scraing, I did fact-check about the table.

## Things I learned
I could use very basic of scraping I learned in the class in practice. Also, I learned how to make scrolltelling with ai2html.

## Things I'd like to do
I used only Wikipedia this time, so in the next (and last) project, I'd like to scrape and analyze sourses I can rely on. If possible, I want to use hiddn API. Also, I'd like to use Imagemagic or animation skill.
